# Python Menu System for Students

This program provides a simple menu system to teach students about Python code. Users can select topics to learn about variables, loops, functions, and more. Each topic displays an explanation and a code example.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal in this directory.
3. Run the program:
   
   ```powershell
   python menu.py
   ```

If you're using VS Code, select the workspace virtual environment interpreter:

```powershell
C:/Users/summe/Desktop/Work/Coding/PythonMenu/.venv/Scripts/python.exe
```

Or run the script directly with that interpreter:

```powershell
C:/Users/summe/Desktop/Work/Coding/PythonMenu/.venv/Scripts/python.exe menu.py
```

No external dependencies are required.
